# Ezerx-internship-works

This repository includes my works during 1st June 2020 to 31st August 2020 in EzeRx Health Tech Private Limited. Here I worked as a Data science intern. I worked with some Biomedical signals which they provided from a non invassive device, buitl by Ezerx Health tech Pvt. Ltd. 

# Dataset description

--The Dataset contains 291 colums. Here 290 coloums are feature and 291th is labels which is continius value betwen 66000 to 88000.

# My work

Here I worked with some Bio medical signals.  I used some preprocessing stpes like abrupt Peak finding, removing noise by Gausiinan filtering (see notebook: name of the file)
Then using histrogram plots try to create some class. At first I solved the given problem as a regression problem, later I solved the problem as a classification problem.
